## The Challenge
In many regions, especially low-income areas, women face significant barriers to healthcare access. Over 60% of women are unable to receive the care they need, leading to preventable complications during pregnancy, undiagnosed PCOS, and late-stage cancer diagnoses. This gap highlights the urgent need for an AI-powered solution that can provide accurate, timely health assistance.

### Key Statistics:
- **Pregnancy**: 210 million pregnancies occur annually, with 20 million facing complications (WHO). Over 60% of women in low-income settings lack access to essential care.
- **Menstrual Health**: 75% of adolescent girls suffer from menstrual disorders, many due to misinformation (ACOG).
- **Pregnancy Risks**: 830 women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications, with 94% of these deaths in low-resource settings (WHO).
- **PCOS**: PCOS affects 10% of women of reproductive age, but 70% remain undiagnosed (PCOS Awareness Association).
- **Breast Cancer**: Leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection increases survival rates by 90% (BCRF).

## Solution
Her-AI Assist leverages cutting-edge AI models to address these pressing health concerns. The platform offers:
1. **Pregnancy Risk Detection**: Predicts pregnancy-related risks based on health data like age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.
2. **PCOS Detection**: Identifies potential PCOS cases by analyzing hormonal data, cycle irregularities, and BMI.
3. **Breast Cancer Detection**: Uses mammographic data to classify tumors, facilitating early cancer detection.
4. **AI Chatbot**: A chatbot powered by NLP, providing real-time, personalized responses to a wide range of women’s health inquiries.

## Features
- **Pregnancy Risk Assessment**: Enter maternal health data (age, BMI, glucose levels) for pregnancy risk prediction.
- **PCOS Prediction**: Provide hormonal data and cycle information to assess the likelihood of PCOS.
- **Breast Cancer Detection**: Upload mammographic images for tumor classification.
- **AI Health Chatbot**: Ask any health-related questions and get instant, tailored responses.

## Data Used
- **Pregnancy Risk**: Maternal Health Risk dataset from UCI.
- **PCOS Detection**: Data on hormonal levels, cycle patterns, and BMI.
- **Breast Cancer Detection**: Mammographic dataset with features such as radius, texture, and compactness.

## Installation
# Setting Up the Virtual Environment

Follow the steps below to create and activate a virtual environment for your project.

## Step 1: Install `virtualenv` (if not already installed)

To create a virtual environment, you need to have `virtualenv` installed. Run the following command to install it:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
## Step 2: Create the Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to create the virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```
This will create a folder named venv that contains the isolated virtual environment.

## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

#Command Prompt (CMD):
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
#PowerShell:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Once activated, you should see the virtual environment name (venv) in your terminal prompt.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary libraries for the project.


## Step 5: Get the Google Studio API Key

To get your Google Studio API key, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Go to the **APIs & Services** dashboard.
4. Click on **Enable APIs and Services**.
5. Search for **Google Cloud AI** or **Google Studio API** and enable it.
6. Navigate to **Credentials** in the left sidebar.
7. Click on **Create Credentials**, then select **API Key**.
8. Copy the generated API key. You will use this in the next step.

## Step 6: Insert the API Key into `her_chatbot.py`

Once you have the API key, insert it into your `her_chatbot.py` file. 

1. Open the `her_chatbot.py` file in a text editor.
2. Find the line where the API key is required. It should look something like this:


3. Replace `"API_KEY"` with your actual API key:

    ```python
    API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"  # Replace with your real Google Studio API key
    ```

4. Save the `her_chatbot.py` file.

Now your chatbot should be configured to interact with the Google Studio API, utilizing the key you've integrated.

## Step 5: Start the App
